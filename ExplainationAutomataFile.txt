To implement your automata in txt for my program :

1st line is ALL the State name
2nd line is ALL the Character
3rd line is the first State
4th line is the set of final State
5th and more are the relation between two state separated by all the Character to acced to it
"State1 AllCharToAccessTo State2"


example (the order of line is important but in the line is not important) :
FirstState StateRandom1 StateRandom2 FinalState
abc
FirstState
FinalState
FirstState a StateRandom
StateRandom abc FinalState
