To implement your automata in txt for my program :

1st line is ALL the State name
2nd line is ALL the Character
3rd line is the first State
4th line is the set of all final State
5th and more are the relation between two state separated by all the Character to acced to it

Format of a transition :
State1 ABCD;= State2.
Here you access to the State2 by the State1 with A or B or C or D or ; or =

If you want to put a space for a transition, you can do it by doing :
State1   State2

example of a Smiley Automata (the order of line is important but in the line is not important) :
Y1 Y2 B N E0
:;-=)(
E0
B
E0 : Y1
E0 ; Y2
Y1 -= N
Y2 - N
N )( B


This automata recognize :
